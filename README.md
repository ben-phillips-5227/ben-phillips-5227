# 👋 Hi, I'm Ben Phillips

🎯 **Data Analyst | Sports Enthusiast | Data Storyteller**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a data analyst who loves turning messy datasets into meaningful stories—especially within the world of sports. I enjoy using data to uncover insights, identify patterns, and explore using a number of different resources in order to grow my skills and expertise in this field!

## ⚙️ Technical Skills

**Languages & Analysis**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, advanced formulas)

**Visualization**
- Tableau
- matplotlib / seaborn / plotly
- ggplot2

**Machine Learning & Modeling**
- Regression (linear/logistic)
- Classification (random forest, k-NN)
- Clustering (KMeans, hierarchical)
- Time Series Forecasting

## 🏟️ Sports Meets Data

My passion for sports and data intersect in projects where I:
- Analyze expected goals (xG) and advanced soccer stats
- Track player/team performance over seasons
- Predict match outcomes using machine learning
- Scrape sports data from public websites like FBref, xgscore.io, and ESPN
- Create dashboards to visualize trends in soccer, basketball, and beyond

## 📌 Featured Projects

- 🧠 **MLS Match Outcome Predictor**: Built a machine learning model to forecast results using xG, shot data, and passing metrics.
- 🧹 **Soccer Data Scraper**: Built a Python tool to scrape player stats and auto-export to CSV for fast analysis.
- 🔍 **KMeans Clustering of Airline Delays**: An assortment of other projects that aren't related to the sports world, but that showcase other data analysis tools such as but not limited to: KMeans Clustering, Random Forests, and Text Mining. These projects can be found using the link below along with documentation of the datasets, my thought processes, and my final conclusions!
